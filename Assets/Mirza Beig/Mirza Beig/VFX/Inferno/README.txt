- VFX "INFERNO" PARTICLE PACK (v1.0.0):

Spritesheets: 8x8, 512px - 1024px per frame.

A collection of high quality spritesheets, textures, and presets using the Shuriken particle system.
Once decompressed into your project, simply drag any prefab from the _prefab folder into your own scene.

You can either start off by editing a prefab, or entirely from scratch using the textures.

The sizes of the single-frame sprite textures vary.

In instantiated particle mode, right-click to spawn a oneshot prefab that will 
destroy itself when it's finished simulating all the particles.

Hidden controls:
- Left-click in instantiated particle mode will constantly spawn the selected prefab.
- Holding "R" in instantiated particle mode will cycle randomly through all the prefabs.
- Holding "R" + "T" in instantiated particle mode will constantly spawn random particles.

NOTES:

This is a free asset. It's free because it was created to test out my Shuriken -> Spritesheet conversion tool
and is based off my other product, VFX "Ultimate" Particle Pack - a unique, all-in-one solution for particles!

Nevertheless, these two are completely DIFFERENT assets! Enjoy!!

Please check it out the latter on the asset store.
