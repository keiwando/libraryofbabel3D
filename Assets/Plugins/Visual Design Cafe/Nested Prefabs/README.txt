Thank you for trying Nested Prefabs.

Nested Prefabs should automatically install in your project after importing the package.
If for some reason the install fails, please reimport all the prefabs and models in the project manually. 
This is necessary because Nested Prefabs has to analyse any existing prefabs and/or models to prepare them for being nested.

The online documentation with a guide on how to use Nested Prefabs can be found here:
https://www.visualdesigncafe.com/nestedprefabs/documentation/

If you have any questions about Nested Prefabs feel free to contact support at:

Or write a post in the forum thread:

Nested Prefabs will automatically check for updates and send bug reports to help improve the extension.
To change this behavior you can edit the preferences in the 'Plugins/Visual Design Cafe/Nested Prefabs/Editor/NestedPrefabsPreferences.cs' script.
